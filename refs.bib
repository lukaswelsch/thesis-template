  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop data quality (DQ) assessment model based on content analysis and metadata analysis. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of DQ assessment models has been conducted. A study of DQ key performances (KPIs) has been done. Finally, the proposed model has been developed and applied in a case study. Findings The results of this study shows that the metadata data have important information about DQ in a database and can be used to assess DQ to provide decision support for decision makers. Originality/value There is a lot of DQ assessment in the literature; however, metadata are not considered in these models. The model developed in this study is based on metadata in addition to the content analysis, to find a quantitative DQ assessment.},

  abstract = {The literature provides a wide range of techniques to assess and improve the quality of data. Due to the diversity and complexity of these techniques, research has recently focused on defining methodologies that help the selection, customization, and application of data quality assessment and improvement techniques. The goal of this article is to provide a systematic and comparative description of such methodologies. Methodologies are compared along several dimensions, including the methodological phases and steps, the strategies and techniques, the data quality dimensions, the types of data, and, finally, the types of information systems addressed by each methodology. The article concludes with a summary description of each methodology.},

Currently, most data quality measures are developed on an ad hoc basis to solve specific problems [6, 8], and fundamental principles necessary for developing usable metrics in practice are lacking. In this article, we describe principles that can help organizations develop usable data quality metrics.},

  abstract = {La qualit\`a dei dati \`e una tematica affrontata in ambito statistico, gestionale, informatico, insieme a molti altri settori scientifici. Il presente articolo considera il problema della definizione della qualit\`a dei dati dal punto di vista informatico. Sono comparate alcune proposte di dimensioni (o caratteristiche) che contribuiscono alla definizione della qualit\`a dei dati e viene introdotta una definizione "base" di tale concetto. E' inoltre illustrata una classificazione che ha l'obiettivo di guidare nella scelta della definizione di qualit\`a dei dati maggiormente adeguata alle proprie esigenze.},
