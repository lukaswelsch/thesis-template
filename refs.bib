  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop data quality (DQ) assessment model based on content analysis and metadata analysis. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of DQ assessment models has been conducted. A study of DQ key performances (KPIs) has been done. Finally, the proposed model has been developed and applied in a case study. Findings The results of this study shows that the metadata data have important information about DQ in a database and can be used to assess DQ to provide decision support for decision makers. Originality/value There is a lot of DQ assessment in the literature; however, metadata are not considered in these models. The model developed in this study is based on metadata in addition to the content analysis, to find a quantitative DQ assessment.},

  abstract = {The literature provides a wide range of techniques to assess and improve the quality of data. Due to the diversity and complexity of these techniques, research has recently focused on defining methodologies that help the selection, customization, and application of data quality assessment and improvement techniques. The goal of this article is to provide a systematic and comparative description of such methodologies. Methodologies are compared along several dimensions, including the methodological phases and steps, the strategies and techniques, the data quality dimensions, the types of data, and, finally, the types of information systems addressed by each methodology. The article concludes with a summary description of each methodology.},

  abstract = {A successful data mining process depends on the data quality of the sources in order to obtain reliable knowledge. Therefore, preprocessing data is required for dealing with data quality criteria. However, preprocessing data has been traditionally seen as a time-consuming and non-trivial task since data quality criteria have to be considered without any guide about how they affect the data mining process. To overcome this situation, in this paper, we propose to analyze the data mining techniques to know the behavior of different data quality criteria on the sources and how they affects the results of the algorithms. To this aim, we have conducted a set of experiments to assess three data quality criteria: completeness, correlation and balance of data. This work is a first step towards considering, in a systematic and structured manner, data quality criteria for supporting and guiding data miners in obtaining reliable knowledge.},

Il presente articolo considera il problema della definizione della qualit\`a dei dati dal punto di vista informatico. Sono comparate alcune proposte di dimensioni (o caratteristiche) che contribuiscono alla definizione della qualit\`a dei dati e viene introdotta una definizione "base" di tale concetto. E' inoltre illustrata una classificazione che ha l'obiettivo di guidare nella scelta della definizione di qualit\`a dei dati maggiormente adeguata alle proprie esigenze.},

  abstract = {Poor data quality (DQ) can have substantial social and economic impacts. Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers.A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context of the task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer.Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers' data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers' experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework.},
